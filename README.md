# Time-Series---Bsc-Final-Year
A basic project of time series analysis 

I learnt time series analysis in 6th semester of my bachelor of statistics course.
Hence, in the dissertation paper, I thought of doing something through which I
will be able to apply my theoritical knowledge in real practical data. At that point of time,
neither I knew LaTeX or was an expert in R ; even I did not know about github,kaggle,etc- and time constraint was also there.
Hence,I do not have that much codes to upload as maximum of the diagrams and computations are done in Minitab.
I am just uploading my final submission.Those who are looking for a guideline to start their
first project in time series analysis may find it helpful :D.
